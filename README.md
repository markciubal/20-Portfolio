## Description
This is a demo of some of the work I can do with React.

I'm satisfied with this version, but I would like to incorporate more work into my portfolio. This assignment intended on gauging an understanding of React fundamentals. I worked mostly on the front end of this website, but I feel like I need to have more back end experience, so I'm looking forward to future assignments! I am particularly happy that the application is clean and responsive.

## User Story
```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
